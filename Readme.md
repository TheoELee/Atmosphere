Atmosphere is a web app that uses your local weather forecast to generate and play a unique Spotify playlist. This is accomplished by using a number of API'S, mainly:  
    - [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)  
    - [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)  
    - [ip-api](https://ip-api.com/)  

Throughout the process of building this app we leveraged a number of tutorials to help us out, namely:
    - [How to create a react app frontend and an express backend](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-react-frontend-a-node-express-backend-and-connect-them-together-c5798926047c/)
    - [How to deploy a react app with an express server on Heroku](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-a-react-app-with-an-express-server-on-heroku-32244fe5a250/)  

For the weather animations, we leveraged free animations made by Steve Gardener (@ste-vg). [The codepen can be found here](https://codepen.io/ste-vg/pen/Gqakbo)
